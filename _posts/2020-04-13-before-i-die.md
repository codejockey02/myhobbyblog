Before I die,  
I want to sit by the window  
See the sun coming & going down  
As we revolve around & round.  
I want to see the aurora  
Driving to the top  
Being awake and waiting  
For the star to fall.  
..............  
Before I die,  
I want to wander  
To the places unvisited & untouched  
I want to be in love.  
From dancing on weird songs  
To singing them together  
Dispersing into the ether.   
I want to find the bliss  
In my own abyss.  
..............  
Before I die  
I want to stay awake.  
I want to be a light.  
I want my epitaph to read  
That I lived wonderful & bright.
