One fine day  
She came to me & asked  
Why are you so silent today?  
Are you thinking about something ?  
Is everything fine with you ?  
And I looked at her,  
Yes, everything is fine.  
Yes, I'm thinking about something.  
I'm thinking about the beauty of silence.  
.......................  
She replied  
I didn't get it  
How can something like silence  
Have a beauty inside it ?  
Okay, just let it be.  
Get ready for the beach walk tonight  
You remember, right ?  
I got up from the bed.  
Yeah, how can I forget.  
We'll leave in 30.  
.......................  
It was a full moon night.  
The beach was looking so bright.  
We both took off our sandals  
Hold them with one of our hands  
And holding each other's hands  
While hugging each other  
We walked side by side.  
Staring at the stars.  
Gazing at the moon.  
Looking at each other's scars  
We almost swoon.  
That was a memorable night.  
We were holding each other so tight.  
.......................  
Another fine day  
She came to the balcony  
Hand me over a cup of coffee  
Held my hand & tangled our feets  
And said.  
Silence is harmony.
