One day you told me,  
You'll hold my hand forever  
Another day / You didn't stay  
Left me in the bad weather.  
One day you told me,  
You know my heart better  
Another day / You didn't stay  
Though my heart was fettered.  
One day you told me,  
I am your solace  
Another day / You didn't stay  
Saying my mind is a mess.  
.............  
One day we planned an evening   
If you remember / You were not deceiving.  
I remember the look in your eyes,  
The way you swayed into my arms  
The way you felt me with your toes,  
Oh love, that charm!  
We planned to lie down  
Under the lilac skies / In the nearby town.  
One day you told me,  
You'll hold my hand forever  
Another day / You didn't stay  
Left me in the bad weather.
