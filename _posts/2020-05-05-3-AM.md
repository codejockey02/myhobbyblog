Dear 3 AM,   
I still remember what Ted Mosby's grandmother said,  
Nothing good happens after 2 AM.  
Then why are you becoming   
such a cliche/  
Why those people,   
when the clock ticks 3,   
find their niche/  
I've heard that people become vulnerable;  
They say things which they never speak,  
Even when their slumber is at the peak.  
You've made some secrets out,  
You've made them share their worst pout.  
You've made them confess their feelings,  
You are a way of some people's healing.  
Also;  
Not all the good things belong to you /  
You've broken many hearts too.  
Their pillows may have absorbed their tears  
But, you've now become a nightmare.  
I still consider you a cliche,  
Though, I am writing this poem at 3 AM   
And finding my niche.   
  
Yours not so Truly  
Priyesh
