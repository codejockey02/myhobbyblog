Had a dream last night,  
We crossed our emotions  
I straightened my spine  
Looked at you with all my devotion.  
I cordoned my mind somehow  
To believe it was all real  
Yet, I was fettered with something unreal.  
I tried to perceive you.  
I tried to behold you.  
I prayed for you to come into my arms.  
But you fade away,  
Taking away that charm.  
I called in my emotions.  
I called in my devotion.  
Had a dream last night.  
Swayed my heart so tight.
