So, I asked her out on a date  
She asked me the venue,  
I said a place you've never been to  
And she laughed   
As to the city / she was new.  
The venue was a nearby cafe,  
Ordered a stretto  
And a regular latte.  
So here comes some awkward conversation  
As we did meet only once at the station  
And, for a person like me, this is really tough  
As I am bad at starting this stuff.  
But, she was exactly the opposite  
And the awkward part didn't seem like it  
She kept on talking about different situations  
Asking me about my things,  
Telling me about hers  
And I was grasping all the information.  
.............  
Then, we decided to go somewhere else  
Again, someplace she hasn't visited yet.  
So, I took her to my favorite place   
A broken tree, moonlight, visible stars;  
A little away from the city's pace.  
And we sat on the broken tree.  
She started talking   
And I was silent,  
Looking at the moon and the stars  
She came a little close to me  
Placed her hand on mine  
And we talked about our scars.  
.............  
It was all diaphanous  
As without uttering a word  
We were comfortable with us.  
At that very moment, we knew  
That this is what it feels like   
The feeling so ineffable and so new.  
I don't care if it's gonna be a dalliance   
I don't care if it's gonna be ephemeral  
I am going to take this chance  
And try to make this thing REAL.  
A broken tree, moonlight, visible stars;  
It became our place. :-)
