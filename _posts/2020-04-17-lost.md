Maybe you had a bad day / or your loved ones didn't stay  
Maybe you lost someone you  / Or your feelings were crushed  
Maybe you got up late in the morning  
Maybe you broke your D string  
Maybe you didn't have the energy today  
Or you stayed in bed all day.  
And you'll say that I'm a fool  
But it's OKAY.  
All of us go through this sometimes  
Or maybe we need this to get unwind.  
And it's OKAY.  
We are locked. And we need to find the key  
But it's nothing to worry,  
Because it's hidden within you & me.  
So, let's get lost in ourselves  
And get connected with our soul  
To prepare a defense for this realm  
And fill our energy bowl.  
.........  
So, let's get LOST.
