You left my text on seen.  
Okay so here are the probable reasons,  
Maybe, you are busy / or you got into a tizzy.  
Maybe, you find me an amorist / or you are interested in satirists.  
Maybe, you just want to ignore me / maybe you hate me.  
Oh, I am going to a pensive mood, will you please allude?  
Maybe, you're just having an important call,  
And I am overthinking for no reason at all,  
Or  
Maybe, you are going through an agony / or you are ambivalent about me.
