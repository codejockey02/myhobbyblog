Jeans pulled off / pajamas on  
Doors shut / speakers on.  
"Playing John Mayer"  
And I sprawled on the bed  
As I was lacking the motivation to write;  
Ain't a single thread.  
...........  
I heard the sound of frogs  
As it was raining cats & dogs.  
This weather always attracted me,  
So I stood up, walked to the window  
And sat there, folding my knees.  
...........  
And I saw someone,  
Standing by the window of her house  
Feeling the rain with her fingers  
As she was trying to touch it,  
She was feeling that drops / making their way through her hands,  
She moved her face to look at her admirer with those hazel eyes  
But I turned a blind eye.  
...........  
That heavy rain;  
brought a silver-lining for me  
Got so many threads,  
That journal was waiting for me;  
To pen down every thought I have  
To write the emotions I felt  
To become an amorist  
As she was an artist.  
I'll write about the way she feels the rain  
As if rain is also forgetting all the pain  
Passing by those slick fingers  
Maybe in a mood to linger.  
I feel of herself as a queen,  
The beauty I've never seen.  
Those hazel eyes filled with sheer delight  
As I took my hat off to her light.  
And I write.  
Ahh, she's an artist!
