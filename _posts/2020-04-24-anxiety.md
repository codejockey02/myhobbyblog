Staring at the wall   
Having no sleep at all  
Right now it's 3'o clock / And I'm counting the sheep flocks.  
Room temperature set at 19 degrees  
Yet, drops of sweat on my face / making the night eerie.  
Thinking about the past  
Regretting the decisions made at last  
Worrying about the future / Will I be a good creature ?  
Brain freezing / Heart throbbing  
It's 4'o clock  
Still counting the flock.  
It's getting dark / Anxiety hitting me hard.  
........tick tok tick tok........  
And yet again  
The Sun shines  
I'm getting fine.
