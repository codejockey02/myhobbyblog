Sometimes I want to go to the terrace   
And shout like crazy,  
Sometimes I want to sit in a corner of my room   
And be lazy.  
Sometimes I want to talk to you / whole day & night  
Sometimes I just want to cut off / and harmonize.  
And sometimes;  
I just want to be happy all the time  
Enjoy every bit & dime  
Be with people who love me the most  
And keep them engrossed.  
Sometimes, I don't want to wait for the stroke of serendipity  
And be happy in this ephemeral reality.  
Sometimes, I ask this question to myself  
Why these mixed feelings stacked up on my shelf   
And what if I pick nothing from this stack  
And create my own shelf.  
Sometimes, I just take what life gives  
And try to perpetuate a path to serendipity.
