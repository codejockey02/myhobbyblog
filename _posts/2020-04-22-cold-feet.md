And here she comes  
So charming;  
Wearing my favorite color  
She's coming towards me  
And I want to disappear.  
Getting a cold feet  
Maybe it is a tradition now  
Whenever we meet / I get it somehow.  
And one part of my brain is busy  
In making some algorithm  
To get my mouth to speak the best ice-breaker  
And the other part is busy singing a rhythm;  
"Oh, can you hold my fire, for me"ðŸŽµ  
"Oh, can you hold my fire, for me"ðŸŽµ  
And my heart beating so fast right now  
She's standing two feet apart now.  
And here comes a notification,  
My brain is ready to start the conversation  
.............  
And here I go, "3-2-1.";  
"Hi."
