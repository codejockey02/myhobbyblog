She walks like she's a queen  
To many people, she's so mean  
She walks with a grace  
Her beauty is worth the embrace  
Her demenour so high  
When she looked at me, I shy.  
Oh milady !  
Will you accept a flower from me ?  
Oh milade !  
Will you walk with me ?  
I promise, I'll hold you tight  
I'll slow my heartbeat  
To live every moment & sight.  
We'll saunter through the beach  
In the moonlight.  
Only if you feel it right  
I promise, I'll hold you tight.  
Oh, she feels like a queen  
But, trust me  
She's not so mean.
