And that was our last meeting / oh that feeling;  
We made some promises / That we promised to keep   
But, promises are meant to be broken / so, I threw them in a corner like a heap;  
We promised not to think about each other,  
Yet I thought about the moments / when we had each other;  
We promised not to see each other,  
Yet I found myself near the tree, / waiting for you to appear.  
And then / after some time / you didn't appear.  
You left. / And I was left with some memories & a quest.  
A quest of you within me, / A quest to live with this eerie.  
A quest of my solace / A quest to fill this void space.  
I thought we had our swan-song  
But we didn't come along.  
I didn't get to say goodbye / or maybe, I meant to stand by.  
Now, I want to make some promises  
Promises that are not meant to be broken;  
Promise me that when I feel sad,  
You'd come over, / and hold me tight.  
Promise me that when I get filled with terror  
You'd come over, / and hold me tight.  
All my fears of life would be peripheral,  
If you'd just come over and hold me tight.  
And at last,  
Promise me that when I leave this entity  
You'd come over to pick me up  
And hold me for eternity.
