When the sun goes down  
I feel something and usually rundown  
As they say  
That morning brings the light  
Which is taken away by the night.  
But there's something much darker  
A knight in the shining armor.  
Yes, he's likely to rescue me from this darkness  
But this is all a huge mess.  
Those songs tricked me to believe  
There exist, someone, to whom you should leave  
Quoted as "A knight in the shining armor",  
But all these thoughts are getting darker.  
........  
And the sun shines  
I'm getting fine.
