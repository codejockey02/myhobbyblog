It was a beautiful sunny day  
Birds chirping, people mowing lawns  
And a fresh breeze all the way.  
Finished the coffee, came inside  
It was different weather indoors, I sighed.  
I lied supine on the sofa, looking at the fan,  
Lying next some 3 weeks older cans.  
Flashback in my mind / how I lost control & plunged my car into a ravine.  
There's been a hurricane in my attic,  
The forecast says that the weather will be static.  
My days are gloomy not only Sunday, / I lived my life around the same bay.  
Maybe I'll go outside someday,  
Maybe I'll visit a new country someday,  
And there will be new weather / Every single day.
