I slept for 10 hours straight  
My body was slumberless  
Drank a coffee, smoked a cigarette  
And got into irritating bate.  
It was going all over again  
It was like riding a bicycle  
With a broken chain.  
Numberless questions piling up the stack  
Need answers to cut some slack.  
And yet I was sitting in a corner  
Posing like a mourner  
I was breathing in & breathing out  
It was like drinking coffee  
From a cracked up pot.  
This was indeed a riddle at this time  
Need to riddle out this  
Before I run out of these dimes.  
And yet I was sitting in a corner  
Posing like a mourner.  
..........  
I breathe in.  
I breathe out.
