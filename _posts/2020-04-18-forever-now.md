I was full of secrets until I met him  
I was scared of people to the brim  
I was scared of being treated like a specimen  
I was scared because I was different  
Then, I was running to different cities  
Running from my different identities  
Now, I bought a place in downtown  
Call it a place of our own.  
Then, I was against all these commitments  
Happy from one night stands  
Now, I am walking the aisle with my daughter  
To take the wedding vows & be with him forever.  
He accepted my secrets / even though I was too late  
..........  
I was full of secrets until I met him  
I am full of love after I met him.
