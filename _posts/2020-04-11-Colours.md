I see us  
In those old english classics  
Fighting like maniacs  
And being with each other  
In those graphics.  
................  
I see us  
In that wedding church  
You, coming through the aisle  
Me, giving you a hand  
Us, taking the vows  
Them, being emotional as we lurch.  
................  
I see us  
In those rom-coms   
Being each other's elixir  
Always fumbling for each other's hands  
With a happily ever after  
As our closure.  
................  
I see us  
In my eyes  
With a lullaby  
With all our gorgeous colours  
I'll see us everywhere  
For the rest of our lives.
