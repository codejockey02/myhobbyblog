"Ok bye."  
Those were the last words   
I've heard.  
Ended up on a bad note / Why were we at that fort?  
Now, it's been a year / for you to be anywhere near.  
We didn't take care of that love  
which could be ethereal.  
That feeling, so fragile / I don't think we deserved that light.  
But it could be better  
The last could be better  
Instead of the fight /, we could've held each other tight  
Because it was our last night.  
We should've been dancing to the harmony  
The stars, the moon, you & me.  
...........  
Now, it's been a year.  
I'm left with a hiraeth in my mind  
Oh, we were so blind.
