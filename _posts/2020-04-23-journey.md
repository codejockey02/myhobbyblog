One day, I was traveling  
From Florida to Alabama  
Leaving my high school / to attend Culver Creek Preparatory high school.  
I had a journey from having no friends to being with some best people.  
And then facing a tragedy making my life dull.  
...........  
One day, I was a rich handsome man  
Friend of Mr. Bingley.  
From being an introvert & dancing in the ball  
To developing a crush towards a girl   
who somehow takes an instant dislike to me /   
Maybe wanting to kill me with an awl  
I had a beautiful journey having a lot of turns, maybe a little bit crazy   
And at last, confessing my love;  
I married that beautiful lady.  
...........  
One day, I was an orphan kid  
Living with my aunt & uncle / On a Number 4 Privet Drive.  
From being treated very bad by the Dursleys  
To discovering a whole new life of wizards  
I had an exquisite life with my best friends.   
Getting to know the epiphany / Discovering dark secrets   
And loving the man I hated the most.  
I thoroughly enjoyed this journey the most.  
...........  
And after each journey,  
I am back to reality / which is a little bit different  
but a different journey.  
And I tend to escape this reality  
To another journey of fantasy, romance, horror  
And become a different person  
An explorer.
