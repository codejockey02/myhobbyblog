And I walk  
Down the same road  
With some flowers in one hand  
And some memories to erode.  
I go there every week / in the hope that she'll speak.  
It's so hard to understand / the most loved thing  
in this world is a detriment.  
the hand I want to hold  
the eyes I want to behold  
are not there / and I,   
I am just an empty soul.  
I know you're at someplace  
conflated within me  
I Keep digging myself down deeper /expecting you to appear   
And tell me that epiphany.  
And I walk  
Down the same road  
With some flowers in one hand  
And some memories to erode.
