People say that a daughter is equal to 10 sons.  
They also say that a daughter is a tension.  

People say Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao,  
They also say Umar ho rahi hai, Shaadi karao.  

People say Mahri beti chhoro se kam hai ke  
They also say, for your daughter, how much will you pay ?  

But you know what a Mother say ?  

Mother says nothing.  
She smiles and let the people know,  
That I confide in her, you let your garbage blow.  
She smiles and let the people know,  
That she will study, she will be independent,  
She will definitely grow.  
Why ?  
Because I confide in her, you let your garbage blow.
